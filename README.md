# OCR for Historical Texts

## Introduction

## Will update tempelate soon......
## Getting Started

To use the OCR tools provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OCR-for-Historical-Texts.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies. Detailed instructions can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Preprocessing:** Preprocess your historical text images. This step may include image enhancement, binarization, noise removal, and deskewing.

4. **OCR:** Perform OCR on preprocessed images using the tools provided. This may involve using open-source OCR engines such as Tesseract, custom-trained models, or a combination of both.

5. **Post-processing:** After OCR, post-process the extracted text to improve accuracy and readability. This may involve spell-checking, language modeling, and formatting.

6. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the OCR results to assess accuracy and identify areas for improvement. This step may involve manual inspection and comparison with ground truth data where available.

## Tools and Resources

- **Tesseract OCR:** Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine maintained by Google. It supports over 100 languages and provides pre-trained models for various scripts and languages.
  
- **Kraken:** Kraken is a flexible OCR engine for printed documents. It supports both line-level and page-level recognition and offers tools for training custom models.

- **OpenCV:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It provides tools for image processing and manipulation, which are useful for preprocessing historical text images.

- **Pillow:** Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork. It adds image processing capabilities to Python, including image opening, manipulation, and saving.
